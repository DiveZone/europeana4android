# europeana.eu for Android

This is a demo application for the Europeana.eu API version 2.

## Contributing to this project
As this is an Open Source project, all contributions/suggestions are welcome.
You can contribute in several ways.

### Report bugs/suggestions
Use the Issues functionality on [our GitHub page](https://github.com/eLedge/europeana.eu) 
to add bug reports or issues. Try to be as specific as possible, mention 
brand and type of hardware, android version, screen size etc etc.

### Contribute code
The easiest way is to create a fork of our project, make your changes and
submit a pull request. Some of the core developers will look at your request
and hopefully merge it into the master branch.

It's also possible to be added to the development team and submit directly
into the repository. But it would be nice if we know you a bit, so use the
fork method first a few times. :-)
